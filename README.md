ğŸ’¡ **What do you mean by git?**

Git is a version control system like Google Docs but for our codebase. It tracks all the changes happening in a file or folder and makes a seperate copy for that. When a problem arises in the current version of our codebase, we can revert back to the last version which does not have any problems.
